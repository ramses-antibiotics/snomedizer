# Overview

## What is SNOMED CT?

SNOMED CT is an international ontology of clinical terms. You can think of it as an encyclopedia on all things that are talked about in medicine, for instance: anatomical structures, diagnoses, medications, tests,  surgical procedures, pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 or *Candidida auris*, or even clinical findings, such as a high temperature.

SNOMED CT is used mainly in the UK:

* to record information about patient care in general practice and hospitals
* to analyse electronic health records, in particular medical notes.

Increasingly, other countries are contributing towards and using SNOMED CT.

The best ways to learn more about SNOMED CT are:

* the [SNOMED International Browser](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/)
* the [SNOMED CT for Data Analysts](https://elearning.ihtsdotools.org/enrol/index.php?id=26) free online learning course
* the official [SNOMED CT Starter Guide](http://snomed.org/sg), particularly chapters [5. Logical Model](http://snomed.org/sg/5.+SNOMED+CT+Logical+Model) and [6. Concept Model](http://snomed.org/sg/6.+SNOMED+CT+Concept+Model)..

## What is snomedizer?

`snomedizer` is an R package to query and manipulate the SNOMED CT terminology.

It allows you to perform the same operations you would on the [SNOMED International Browser](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/).

`snomedizer` is based on [Snowstorm](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snowstorm/), the official SNOMED CT Terminology Server. Snowstorm is the back-end terminology service for both the [SNOMED International Browser](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/) and the SNOMED International Authoring Platform.

# Introduction to SNOMED CT

SNOMED CT contains rich knowledge about medical concepts.

Try for yourself with the quick exercise below:

1. Go to the [SNOMED CT International Browser](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/) 
2. In the 'Search' tab, type in `40600002` 
3. Click on 'Pneumococcal bronchitis' in the result list
4. In the right panel ('Concept Details'), click the 'Details' tab
5. Look for the relationships: the ontology defines that this concept is a bronchitis, and that the pathological process is infectious (non-infective bronchites exist). It also specifies that the pathogen is *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
6. Now click on the 'Diagram' tab. The same information is displayed graphically. Purple boxes refer to `116680003 | Is a (attribute) |` relationships, while yellow boxes notate other attributes of the concept.
7. In the 'Refsets' tab, you will see that this concept is mapped to ICD-10 code J20.2.
8. Bonus: Search for `9861002` and inspect the various tabs. As you can see, SNOMED CT knows that *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is the scientific name of pneumonoccus, and that it is a gram-positive baterium of genus *Streptococcus*.

# How to perform advanced queries (ECL)

SNOMED CT has a query language named ['ECL' (Expression Constraint Language)](http://snomed.org/ecl). ECL enables users to perform logical queries and learn new facts from any SNOMED CT concept.

ECL relies on logical operators listed in this [ECL quick reference table](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCECL/Appendix+D+-+ECL+Quick+reference).

You can submit ECL queries in snomedizer using the `concepts_find()` function:

```{r setup_snomedizer }
# Connect to the SNOMED International endpoint 
# (see licence conditions in `vignette("snomedizer")`).
snomedizer_options_set(
  endpoint = "https://snowstorm.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct", 
  branch = "MAIN/2021-07-31"
)

## fetch all pneumonia concepts
pneumo_concepts <- concepts_find(ecl = "<<233604007 | Pneumonia (disorder) |")
glimpse(pneumo_concepts)
```


<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
<h4>Trying ECL in the web browser</h4>

# Examples

## 1. Search for relevant urine specimens

Urine tests are very common in hospitals, for instance to perform microbial cultures. Let's assume we access a laboratory database in which all bacterial cultures are stored with SNOMED CT codes for the specimen type.

There are many types of urine samples, eg: samples of morning urine, mid-stream urine, etc. Some are not optimal samples: for example, urine catheter samples are often contaminated and may give poor information. Let's try and

* fetch all the codes corresponding to urine specimens: they are descendants of `122575003 | Urine specimen (specimen) |`
* while excluding the ones from urinary catheters (`122565001 | Urinary catheter specimen (specimen) |`).

First, we need to query descendant concepts. This can be done using `concepts_descendants()`. But we can also use the `<<` operator (known as `descendantOrSelfOf`) using ECL. All the expressions below are equivalent.

```{r demo_urine_1}
urine_specimens <- concepts_descendants(conceptIds = "122575003")
urine_specimens <- concepts_find(ecl = "<<122575003")
urine_specimens <- concepts_find(ecl = "<<122575003 | Urine specimen (specimen) |")
glimpse(urine_specimens[, c("conceptId", "pt.term")])
```

We obtain 40 concepts. But these include some samples obtained from catheters:

```{r demo_urine_2}
urine_specimens %>% 
  filter(grepl("catheter", pt.term)) %>% 
  select(pt.term)
```

To exclude those, we make use of the `MINUS` operator in ECL:

```{r demo_urine_3}
urine_specimens <- concepts_find(
  ecl = "
  <<122575003 | Urine specimen (specimen) | MINUS 
     ( <<122565001 | Urinary catheter specimen (specimen) |  OR
       <<447589008 | Urine specimen obtained by single catheterization of bladder (specimen) | )
  ")
glimpse(urine_specimens[, c("conceptId", "pt.term")])
```

This now gives us the set of 34 target concepts.

*Note:* For guidance on ECL operators such as `MINUS` or `OR`, see the [ECL quick reference table](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCECL/Appendix+D+-+ECL+Quick+reference).


## 2. Find the dose of a medical product

Let's assume you have electronic prescription records referenced to SNOMED CT medical products. We come across a prescription for SNOMED CT code `374646004`, which references Amoxicillin 500 mg oral tablets, and want to extract the antibiotic type, dose and unit.

*Note:* medical product definitions vary considerably across SNOMED CT editions. In this example, we will use the United States Edition.

We want to extract *attributes*, which are SNOMED CT relationships giving characteristics of a concept. Attributes can be queries using the `.` (dot) operator.

First, let's look at the antibiotic, which is expressed by attribute `762949000 | Has precise active ingredient (attribute) |`.

```{r find_amox_drug}
concepts_find(ecl="374646004.(<<762705008 | Concept model object attribute (attribute) |) ", 
              branch="MAIN/SNOMEDCT-US") %>% 
  select(conceptId, fsn.term)
```

We could query other attributes sequentially (or chain them with `OR` operators in a single ECL expression). But here, the simplest way is to extract all attributes. We do this by remembering that attributes are merely SNOMED CT concepts descending from `762705008 | Concept model object attribute (attribute) |`.

```{r find_amox_attributes}
drug_attributes <- concepts_find(
  ecl="374646004.(<<762705008 | Concept model object attribute (attribute) |) ", 
  branch="MAIN/SNOMEDCT-US/2021-03-01")
drug_attributes$fsn.term
```

However, this approach only provides the value of the attribute, not the attribute name.

A more complex, but effective approach involves a special REST endpoint in Snowstorm: [`GET /{branch}/relationships`](https://snowstorm.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct/swagger-ui.html#!/Relationships/findRelationshipsUsingGET). We can issue a request to this endpoint directly using the low-level function `api_relationships()`. Like all low-level `api_operations`, it is necessary to (1) explicitly request only active concepts, and (2) flatten the output into a data frame. We shall also exclude `116680003 | Is a |` attributes (which express inheritance from parent concepts) as they are not relevant in this instance.

```{r}
drug_attributes <- api_relationships(
  source = "374646004", 
  active = TRUE, 
  branch="MAIN/SNOMEDCT-US/2021-03-01"
) %>% 
  snomedizer::result_flatten()

drug_attributes %>% 
  filter(type.pt.term != "Is a") %>% 
  select(type.fsn.term, target.pt.term) %>% 
  arrange(type.fsn.term)
  
```

## 3. Find all diseases caused by a type of bacterium

Let's extract all infections that can be caused by bacteria belonging to `106544002 | Family Enterobacteriaceae (organism) |`.

To do this, we use the refine `:` operator. 

```{r find_enterobac_infections, paged.print=FALSE}
enterobac_infections <- concepts_find(
  ecl="<<40733004 | Infectious disease (disorder) | :  
             246075003 |Causative agent|  =  <<106544002",
  limit = 5000
)

enterobac_infections %>% 
  select(conceptId, pt.term)
``` 

*Bonus exercise:* Now, extract all body structures that can be infected by the family *Enterobacteriaceae*. Tip: you will need the reversed refine operator `: R`.

<!-- <<123037004 | Body structure (body structure) |  : R  363698007 |Finding site|  =
(<<40733004 | Infectious disease (disorder) | :  
             246075003 |Causative agent|  =  <<106544002)
-->

## 4. Find synonyms of a concept

Some concepts may have many different names.

Let's extract synonyms of 'candidiasis':

```{r syn_78048006}
concepts_descriptions(conceptIds = "78048006") %>% 
  .[["78048006"]] %>% 
  filter(type == "SYNONYM") %>% 
  select(term)
```

Condition `type == "SYNONYM"` is there to remove the redundant fully specified name 'Candidiasis (disorder)'.

We can also search for those terms in, say, Spanish, by querying the branch containing the Spanish Edition.

```{r syn_78048006_fr}
concepts_descriptions(conceptIds = "78048006", branch = "MAIN/SNOMEDCT-ES/2021-04-30") %>% 
  .[["78048006"]] %>% 
  filter(type == "SYNONYM" & lang == "es") %>% 
  select(term)
```
