<p class="lead">
<code>snomedizer</code> is an R package to manipulate the SNOMED clinical ontology using the 
   [SNOMED CT Terminology Server REST API](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snowstorm).
</p>

## Installation

<!-- 
You can install the released version of snomedizer from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("snomedizer")
```
-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/ramses-antibiotics/snomedizer) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ramses-antibiotics/snomedizer")
```

## Example

`snomedizer` provides a direct interface to the SNOMED CT Terminology Server REST API. 

By default, the package uses the public [SNOMED International server](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct/) available for reference purposes **only** (see [terms & conditions](#terms--conditions)).

For example, [`GET /branch/concepts`](https://snowstorm.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct/swagger-ui.html#!/Concepts/findConceptsUsingGET) is implemented in `api_concepts()`:

```{r api_concepts_pneumonia}
library(snomedizer)
api_concepts(term = "pneumonia", activeFilter = TRUE)
```

Simpler wrapper functions are available for common operations, which provide results as data frames:

```{r concepts_find_pneumonia, warning=TRUE}
concepts_find(term = "pneumonia", limit = 5) %>% 
  dplyr::select(conceptId, fsn.term, pt.term) 
```

Do not hesitate to [get in touch on GitHub](https://github.com/ramses-antibiotics/snomedizer/issues) to report bugs or request new features.

## Terms & conditions

### Server endpoint

By default, `snomedizer` queries the [public SNOMED-CT terminology endpoint](https://snowstorm.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct/swagger-ui.html) hosted by SNOMED International.

This server has no service level agreement and **MUST NOT be used as part of production systems in healthcare settings**, even if you hold a SNOMED CT licence.

Please refer to the [Snowstorm documentation](https://github.com/IHTSDO/snowstorm/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) for instructions on how to build a dedicated endpoint for production.

### SNOMED CT Terminology

In order to use SNOMED-CT terminology, a licence is required which depends both on the country you are based in, and the purpose of your work.

SNOMED International maintains a public SNOMED-CT terminology server for strict 'reference purposes' under the [SNOMED International SNOMED CT Browser License Agreement](https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/).

Use of SNOMED-CT terminology for data analysis or health care production systems is subject to other licences. Some users are eligible for free licences:

- UK-based users can obtain a licence free of charge on the [NHS TRUD website](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3).
- residents of other Member Countries and low-income countries are also eligible. More information can be found on the [SNOMED International website](https://www.snomed.org/snomed-ct/get-snomed).
